# State-Dependent Decision-Making in Human Drivers: A Study of Choice Behavior in Car Driving

## Abstract

This thesis aims to investigate the state-dependent decision-making of human drivers in car driving, specifically focusing on the discrete-continuous models used for determining their choice behavior. With the rise of autonomous vehicles, understanding the behavior of human drivers is crucial in developing effective and safe autonomous driving systems. The study will explore the evolution of autonomous vehicle technology from ex-ante rule-based algorithms to a learning approach that incorporates the human driver's behavior. The study will also examine the state-dependent alternatives that human drivers face while driving a car, such as accelerating, braking, and turning left or right. Through the use of the models, this thesis will provide insights into the decision-making process of human drivers and the factors that influence their choice behavior. The findings of this study will contribute to the development of more efficient and safe autonomous driving systems that can replicate the decision-making processes of human drivers.
