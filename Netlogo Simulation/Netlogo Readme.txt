NetLogo 2D Simulation: Human Driving Behavior Simulator

Introduction:

This README provides detailed guidelines for installing and running the NetLogo 2D simulation developed as a part of the master's thesis titled "State-Dependent Decision-Making in Human Drivers: A Study of Choice Behavior in Car Driving." This simulation aims to offer an extensive visual analysis of state-dependent decision-making in human drivers. By employing simulation techniques, the thesis aims to enrich the understanding of discrete-continuous models in human driving choice behavior.
